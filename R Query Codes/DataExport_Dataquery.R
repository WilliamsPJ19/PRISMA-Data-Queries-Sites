#* Extracting previous week's queries 
#*****************************************************************************
# we want to remove any query that the site said was not actually something that needed to be flagged - remove below
## Step 1. Extract the Query IDs that are not queries (Remove edit == 1)

  relocate(QueryID, .before = ScrnID) %>%

## Step 2. rbind all new non-queries into running document
non_queries_merged <- bind_rows(non_queries, queryid_to_remove)

non_queries_merged <- non_queries_merged %>% distinct() ## extract unique elements (only want the newest entries included)

## Step 3. Extract all non-queries into running document 
write.xlsx(non_queries_merged, file = paste("~/PRiSMAv2Data/", site, "/", site_label, "_non-queries-ongoing", ".xlsx", sep = ""))

## Step 4. Convert to vector
queryid_to_remove_vec =  non_queries_merged %>% pull(as.vector(QueryID)) ## extract vector of query IDs to remove
